# Node-QuizzApp

Timed Questions: 

○ Use setInterval to display the remaining time for each question. 
○ Implement a countdown timer for the entire quiz duration. 


2. Asynchronous Question Handling: ○ Ensure questions are asked asynchronously without blocking the main event loop. 
○ Handle user input asynchronously using readline-sync.

4. Dynamic Question Handling: ○ Allow the quiz to dynamically move to the next question after the previous one is answered or if the time for the current question runs out.


5. Quiz Termination: ○ Stop the quiz if all questions are answered before time runs out. ○ Display the final score once the quiz ends.


6. Error Handling: ○ Handle cases where user input is invalid or the quiz times out.
