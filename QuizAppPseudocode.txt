# Pseudocode for Node.js Quiz App

---

## Define Class `QuizApp`

- **Properties:**
  - `questions`: A list of questions (each containing `text` and `answer`).
  - `score`: Stores the user’s score, initially set to 0.
  - `totalQuizTime`: Total time allowed for the entire quiz, converted to milliseconds.
  - `timePerQuestion`: Maximum time allowed per question (15 seconds), in milliseconds.

---

## Method: `start`

1. Display a message indicating the quiz is starting and explain time limits.
2. Calculate the end time for the quiz by adding `totalQuizTime` to the current time.
3. Set the initial `questionIndex` to 0.

4. **Loop through questions as long as:**
   - There are more questions (`questionIndex < total number of questions`).
   - The current time is less than the calculated quiz end time.

5. **Within the loop:**
   - Retrieve the current question using `questionIndex`.
   - Calculate the remaining quiz time.
   - Call `askQuestion` asynchronously, passing the current question and remaining quiz time.
     - **If answer is correct**, increment `score` by 1.
     - **If answer is incorrect or times out**, continue without changing the score.

6. Move to the next question by incrementing `questionIndex`.

7. Once the quiz is over, display a message showing the user’s final score.

## Method: `askQuestion`

1. Display the question text for the current question.
2. Start a countdown using `setInterval` to show the remaining time every second.

3. Set a timeout (`questionTimeout`) for the current question, using either `timePerQuestion` or remaining quiz time, whichever is shorter.
   - **If the question times out:** Display "Time up for this question!" and resolve the promise as `false` (incorrect answer).

4. Prompt the user for input using `readline-sync`.

5. **Clear `questionTimeout` and `interval` timers** to stop the countdown.

6. **Check if the user’s answer matches the correct answer:**
   - Compare both answers in lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
   - If correct, display "Correct!" and resolve the promise as `true`.
   - If incorrect, display "Incorrect!" and resolve the promise as `false`.

## Initialize and Run Quiz App

1. Define a list of questions, each containing `text` and `answer`.
2. Create an instance of `QuizApp`, passing in the list of questions and total quiz time.
3. Call `start` on the `QuizApp` instance to begin the quiz.
